# Query

##Information

* A Q & A Wiki, similar to Quora, that allows users to create public and private Q & A wikis.

* Source code [available on Gitbub](https://github.com/alexhawkins/query) 

* Demo available on [Heroku](http://lit-peak-5935.herokuapp.com/)

##Setup

Make a copy of `config/application.example.yml` and name it `application.yml`. It will be used to store your credential information. The `application.yml` file must be included in `.gitignore` to prevent public access to your credentials once your code is pushed to Github.
